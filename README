Our paper includes an appendix (SA3) which, with some editing of model details, can be used to recreate almost all of our presented results, with the exception of a few Appendix analyses.
In this file we include all the code that was simulated to develop our figures and results.
Individual .R files correspond to model specifics (e.g. SIRM is the Reservoir model, SIRSMlg is the Reservoir-Impermanent-Logistic model) and/or code used to generate appendices.
.csv files are simulation output that correspond with the model of the same name.
The works herein are the results of 5 years of simulation and analysis. They represent a grad student's journey from learning how to code up to publication.
